name: lf-tasks
description: Create, schedule, edit or cancel loompa-forge (lf) tasks, the Markdown files that queue work for coding agents to run later. Use when the user asks to add, queue or schedule a task (for this repo or another), to set up something recurring ("every night...", "each Monday..."), or to change or drop queued work.
---

# Managing lf tasks

The queue lives in `{home}`. The full format is in `{home}/FORMAT.md`; read
it if anything here is unclear. Run every command exactly as written here
(`{lf} ...`), from any folder.

A task is run later, by another agent, in the target repo. That agent has no
access to this conversation. Your job is to turn what the user said into a
task it can carry out.

## 1. Work out the details

- **Repo**: an absolute path or one starting with `~`. "This repo", or no
  repo at all while you're working in a git repo outside `{home}`, means that
  repo's root (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`). If the user gives only a
  name, look for it in the `REPO` column of `{lf} ls`, `{lf} ls --archive` and
  `{lf} ls --schedules`, or check that `~/Projects/<name>` exists. If it's
  still ambiguous, ask. Don't guess.
- **What to do**: if the request is vague ("clean up the auth code"), ask
  one or two questions before you queue it. A vague task wastes a whole run.
- **When**: now (the default), at a given time, after a delay, or on a
  recurring schedule (see section 4).
- **Only set fields the user asked for.** Anything you leave out falls back
  to `[defaults]` in `{home}/config.toml`, which is what the user expects.
  Examples: "open a PR" → `--on-finish pr`; "I'll drive it" →
  `--mode interactive`; "use codex" → `--agent codex` (the allowed names are
  the `[agents.*]` sections in config.toml); a named model → `--model` with
  the model id in the form that agent's CLI expects.

## 2. Write the prompt

The prompt is the task body. Write it for an engineer who is new to the repo
and can't ask questions (headless runs have nobody to answer):

- **Goal**: the outcome, in one or two sentences.
- **Context**: everything the user gave you, such as error messages, file
  names, issue links and reproduction steps. Copy them, don't summarize.
- **Constraints**: anything the user wants done, or left alone.
- **Done when**: how to check the work, e.g. which tests or commands must
  pass, and "add a regression test" if it's a bug fix.
- **If blocked**: tell the agent to stop and explain what's missing instead
  of guessing.

Don't invent requirements the user didn't ask for. Don't mention lf; the
runner handles branches, worktrees, commits and PRs as configured.

## 3. Create the task with `{lf} add`

Always use `{lf} add`, never a hand-written file in `{home}/tasks/`. It
validates the task before creating it, picks a unique id, and stores
`created_at`, so `lf run` never sees a half-written task.

```sh
{lf} add --repo ~/Projects/myapp --created-by agent --on-finish pr <<'EOF'
Fix the redirect loop after login when the session cookie has expired.

Reproduce: log in, delete the `session` cookie, reload /dashboard. The
browser loops between /login and /dashboard.

Done when: the expired-session case redirects to /login once, and a
regression test covers it. `npm test` passes.
EOF
```

Options (all optional except `--repo`):

| Option | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `--id <id>` | File name and id: `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`. Default: derived from the prompt's first line. Pass a short descriptive one. |
| `--branch <name>` | Default `lf/<id>`. |
| `--no-worktree` | Work directly in the repo checkout. |
| `--agent <name>`, `--model <id>` | See step 1. |
| `--mode headless\|interactive` | |
| `--on-finish none\|commit\|push\|pr` | |
| `--retries <n>`, `--retry-delay 5m`, `--timeout 2h` | |
| `--at <RFC 3339>` | e.g. `2026-09-28T02:00:00+02:00`. Use the local UTC offset (`date +%:z`). |
| `--in <duration>` | e.g. `2h`. |

On success it prints the new file's path. On failure it lists the problems;
fix them and run it again.

## 4. Recurring work: schedules

For "every night", "each Monday" and the like, write
`{home}/schedules/<id>.md` yourself. Use `id` plus the fields from step 1
(`repo`, `branch`, `agent`, `model`, ...), plus a quoted 5-field `cron` in
local time. Schedules have no `created_by`/`created_at`/`scheduled_at`: each
firing sets those on the task it creates. The body is the prompt, written as
in step 2.

```markdown
---
id: weekly-deps
cron: "0 6 * * 1"
repo: ~/Projects/myapp
on_finish: pr
---

Update dependencies to their latest compatible versions...
```

Then run `{lf} validate {home}/schedules/<id>.md` and fix anything it
reports. Use an id that doesn't already exist in `{home}/schedules/`. The schedule first
fires at the next matching time after `lf run` sees it. A firing is skipped
while the previous task from the same schedule is still queued or running;
add `allow_overlap: true` only if the user wants runs to pile up.

## 5. Changing or dropping queued work

- Check the current state with `{lf} ls` (or read the file) first.
- **Pending tasks** and **schedules**: you may edit the prompt and the fields
  from step 1, then run `{lf} validate <file>`. To pause a schedule, set
  `enabled: false`.
- Change a status only with these commands, and confirm with the user first:
  `{lf} cancel <id>` (pending or running), `{lf} retry <id>` (failed,
  cancelled or needs_review: requeues it), `{lf} done <id>` (runs
  `on_finish`, e.g. opens the PR) and `{lf} fail <id> -r "<why>"`. The
  `error:` field says why a task failed; `{lf} logs <id>` prints its output.
- Never edit fields lf writes (`status`, `attempts`, `started_at`,
  `finished_at`, `exit_code`, `tmux_window`, `error`, `interruptions`,
  `last_enqueued_at`),
  and never delete task files.
- Don't edit `running` tasks, or anything in `{home}/archive/`, `logs/` or
  `worktrees/`.

## 6. Report back

Tell the user the task id, when it will start, and what happens when it
finishes (e.g. "opens a PR on `lf/fix-login-redirect`"). If it should start
soon, remind them that tasks only run while `lf run` is running.
